# Online Marketplace Microservices Project

Example how to build an online marketplace with smart contracts

This ia a draft of how to transform a business model into a smart contract:

Define the Business Logic: Analyze the business model and identify key processes, rules, and interactions that need to be automated or enforced by a smart contract. For example, if the business model is a marketplace, key elements might be transactions, product listings, payments, and delivery.

Convert Processes into Contract Logic: Translate each business process into smart contract logic. For example, a payment process would include escrow, conditions for releasing funds, and handling disputes. Ensure that terms such as service delivery or refund policies are clearly codified.

Identify Stakeholders: Clarify the roles of each participant (buyer, seller, platform, etc.) and define their permissions and responsibilities within the contract.

State Changes and Conditions: Break down the contract into conditions (e.g., "If a product is delivered, release payment") and define how the contract's state changes based on these conditions.

Write the Smart Contract: Using a framework like Vyper or Solidity, write the code that reflects the business logic. For example, a simple escrow contract could handle payments between buyers and sellers.

Test and Deploy: Before deploying the smart contract to a blockchain, thoroughly test it in a development environment, simulating all potential business scenarios, including edge cases.

Once deployed, the smart contract will enforce the business rules autonomously, removing the need for intermediaries and reducing disputes.

--------------------------------------------------------------

This project contains a set of microservices for an online marketplace, including payment, user, product, and order services. Each service is built with Python (Flask), Dockerized, and orchestrated using Kubernetes (K8s).

## Project Structure
- `services/`: Contains the code for all microservices.
- `k8s/`: Kubernetes configuration files for deploying the services.
- `ci-cd/`: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline configuration.

## Running the Services

1. Build and run services with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
